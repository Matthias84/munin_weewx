Munin script to monitor weather station connectivity and battery via Weewx.
Place plugins at /etc/munin/plugins and restart your munin-node ([read more](http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/HowToWritePlugins)).

Tested with [FineOffset WS1080](http://www.weewx.com/docs/hardware.htm#fousb_data12) and raspberry pi.
You might need to adapt the corresponding fields to your own weather station!
